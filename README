         It all started as a test to try the mrdoob's 
         frameworks three.js and frame.js and see if 
         I could make a demo with the freedom I had in 
         c++ years ago.

         "This way" (http://pouet.net/prod.php?which=7086) 
         was the Euskal Party 2002 winner demo created 
         by the demo group Stravaganza.
         It was one of the first demos I saw live at 
         a party and it was also in that party when I 
         met the stravaganza team members.

         Three years later I joined the group and my 
         first production was a remake of the original 
         demo, but this time in 64kb
         (http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=16676).

         So as this demo it's very special for me I 
         thought it would be interesting to do again a 
         remake but this time in webgl/js.
         I knew this would be harder than creating a 
         demo from scratch: when you create a new demo 
         on a new platform you could be tempted to use 
         the effects you're getting while experimenting 
         without a clear predefined look.

         However to make a remake I should find a way 
         to recreate exactly the effects that once we 
         did in c++/opengl.

         I was sending screenshots to Reality3D^RGBA 
         during the process and he proposed to try to 
         give a slightly more modern air to each scene.

         I didn't want to create a whole new demo that 
         was completely different from the original, but 
         since the demo was created 12 years ago (ouch!) 
         some scenes looks so simple now so I tried to 
         "improve" them a bit (Sorry Tekno O:))
         Reality3D's help was very important to achieve 
         an acceptable aesthetic. Besides changes to some 
         materials, he also modified some of the meshes 
         that Tekno did for the original demo.

         Regarding javascript/webgl/three.js/frame.js 
         experience I think it would be worth writing a 
         blogpost about it. 
         I must admit it has been fairly easy to start 
         painting something on screen, but then it was 
         quite frustrating at times with more complex 
         stuff, not to mention my problems while using 
         geometry exporter :\

         I think it's funny how different it's the 
         release process compared to oldstyle c++ demos.
         When I was programming in c++/64k I could have 
         the code full of hacks, but you just needed to 
         compile and pack the .exe and you were done.
         Now that all your code is exposed and you 
         upload it usually to github and so on, you 
         should care about how it looks. I've had to 
         do refactoring from time to time and force 
         myself to remove the hacks I was putting 
         while testing new effects :)

         As overall conclusion, I'm pretty happy with 
         the result, it wasn't as easy as I thought 
         but I think it also looks much better that 
         I initially expected.
